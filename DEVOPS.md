---

## **Level 1 – Core Concepts**

- **DevOps mindset** = bridge between Developers & Operations.
- **SDLC** → Software Development Lifecycle.
- **Agile & Scrum** basics.
- **CI/CD principles** → build, test, deploy automation.

---

## **Level 2 – Version Control & Collaboration**

- Git branches, merge, rebase.
- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Bitbucket pipelines.
- Pull requests, code reviews, workflows.

---

## **Level 3 – Continuous Integration (CI)**

- Automated builds (Node, Java, Python projects).
- Running tests in pipeline (unit, integration).
- Static analysis & linting in CI.
- Artifact storage (Nexus, Artifactory, GitHub Packages).

---

## **Level 4 – Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**

- Auto-deploy to staging/prod.
- Blue-green deployments.
- Canary releases.
- Rollbacks & feature flags.

---

## **Level 5 – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

- **Terraform** → manage cloud infra as code.
- **Ansible** / **Chef** / **Puppet** → server automation.
- **CloudFormation** (AWS native).
- **Vault** (HashiCorp) → secrets management.

---

## **Level 6 – Containerization**

- **Docker** → images, containers, volumes, networks.
- **Docker Compose** → multi-container apps.
- Image optimization, security scanning.

---

## **Level 7 – Container Orchestration**

- **Kubernetes (K8s)** → pods, deployments, services.
- Helm charts (K8s templates).
- Operators & CRDs.
- Service mesh → Istio, Linkerd.
- Auto-scaling & self-healing apps.

---

## **Level 8 – Cloud Providers**

- **AWS** → EC2, S3, RDS, ECS, EKS, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch.
- **GCP** → Compute Engine, Cloud Run, GKE, Firestore.
- **Azure** → App Service, AKS, Functions.
- **Hybrid/Multi-cloud** concepts.

---

## **Level 9 – Monitoring & Logging**

- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Grafana.

- **Tracing**: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry.
- Alerts & dashboards.

---

## **Level 10 – Security & Compliance**

- Identity & Access Management (IAM).
- TLS/SSL certificates, HTTPS.
- Secrets management (Vault, KMS, SOPS).
- Vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Aqua, Clair).
- Compliance → GDPR, SOC2, ISO standards.

---

## **Level 11 – Advanced Practices**

- **Microservices orchestration** (K8s + service mesh).
- **Serverless DevOps** → AWS Lambda, GCP Functions, Cloudflare Workers.
- **GitOps** → ArgoCD, Flux.
- **Chaos Engineering** → Gremlin, Litmus.
- **FinOps** → cost monitoring/optimization.

---

## **Level 12 – Industry-Level DevOps**

- Multi-region, high availability setups.
- Disaster recovery planning.
- Scaling pipelines for big teams.
- Observability (metrics + logs + tracing unified).
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices.
